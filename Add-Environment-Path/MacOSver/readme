## How to use
- Copy the Bash script into a text editor and save it with a .sh extension, for example, add_to_path.sh.
- Make the script executable by running chmod +x add_to_path.sh in the terminal.
Run the script by passing the directory you want to add as an argument, like this: ./add_to_path.sh /path/to/your/directory
